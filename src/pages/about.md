My name is Victor Abuka. If you are here, chances are that you already knew that. I like to make memes and make music but if I'm being serious I am an Engineer.

At the time of this writing I am an Electrical/Electronics Engineering major at the University of Ibadan. I am also a Fullstack Software Engineer.

I started coding in 2014 but I was off and on till I got my first job as a backend dev in 2021. Years of playing around code inspired my decision for EEE when it was time to get into college. I kind of knew software so I had to know the hardware too. I do not regret that decision. I never have.

My professional development skills range from front and back-end development to mobile development and operations.

Currently I’m a software engineer at Xpathedge, where I’m leading a team building the future of education management.

I write simple articles about technical concepts and occasionally do sanity checklists and deep dives.

I have some experience teaching, professionally, Physics, Mathematics and more recently Software Engineering. I also sometimes speak at conferences and events.

I love writing about the things I am learning and usually I am soaked in the beauty of the world but right now I have my eyes on these majorly:

*   Low level and Graphics Programming
    
*   AI/ML
    
*   Solopreneurship
    
*   Firmware Development
    

I have a few cats that own me and when I am not working or schooling, I enjoy making or listening to music, playing games and chatting with friends about the stupidest things we can think about.
